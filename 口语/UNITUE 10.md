我经常买本地产品和有机产品，使用节能冰箱和可循环纸张和可再生能源，比如天然气。   我家没有太阳能产品。     我认为对一个国家可持续发展至关重要。

I usually buy locally grown and organic produce, use energy-efficient fridge an, recycled paper and renewable energy such as natural gas.  there are't solar-powered produce in my house. I suppose  the sustainable development is curical for a country.
